## Demo of User Wallet with Transaction and Airdop

This builds on another repo here to connect a user's wallet, request an airdrop to that wallet on devnet, and then ping the Solana program which increments a counter.

Keep in mind you have to go to your installed Phantom wallet settings and change them to devnet - not the wallet shown by the MultiButton in this app.
